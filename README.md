# 📊 Exploring Data Warehouse Schemas in Azure Synapse Analytics

## Overview

In this lab, I worked with a **dedicated SQL pool** in Azure Synapse Analytics to explore and analyze data stored in a **relational data warehouse**. This involved understanding the **star and snowflake schemas**, querying **fact and dimension tables**, and applying **window functions** to perform advanced analytical operations.

## 🧠 What I Did

- 🚀 Started and connected to a dedicated SQL pool in Synapse Studio
- 🗂️ Explored the schema of a data warehouse with:
  - Fact and dimension tables
  - Hierarchical relationships (e.g., product → subcategory → category)
  - Time dimension with various levels of granularity

- 🧮 Queried and aggregated sales data across dimensions:
  - Yearly and monthly sales trends
  - Regional and category-based aggregations
  - Snowflake schema joins across multiple dimensions

- 📈 Applied advanced SQL techniques:
  - **Window functions** like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `SUM() OVER()`, and `AVG() OVER()`
  - Grouping with partitions to rank and analyze data by region and city

## ✅ Key Learnings

- How **dimensional modeling** supports analytical workloads
- How to **aggregate data** using multiple levels of granularity
- Real-world use of **SQL windowing and ranking functions** for reporting
- Differences between **star vs. snowflake** schemas in warehouse design

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Dedicated SQL Pools
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)
